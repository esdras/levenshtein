# The Levenshtein distance is a metric for measuring the amount
# of difference between two sequences (i.e., the so called edit
# distance). The Levenshtein distance between two sequences is
# given by the minimum number of operations needed to transform
# one sequence into the other, where an operation is an
# insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single element.
#
# More information about the Levenshtein distance algorithm:
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance .
